    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chingri Malai Curry is a rich and aromatic dish from the Bengal region, popular in both Bangladesh and West
        Bengal, India. This dish features succulent prawns (chingri) cooked in a velvety coconut milk gravy infused with
        fragrant spices. It is often served on special occasions such as weddings, family gatherings, and festivals like
        Eid and Pohela Boishakh.
    </p>
    <p> The term "Malai" refers to cream, but in this dish, it signifies the luxurious texture of the coconut milk-based
        gravy rather than actual dairy cream. The dish has a delicate balance of sweetness from the coconut milk and a
        mild heat from green chilies, making it a perfect accompaniment to fragrant basmati rice or plain white rice.
