    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ilish Maach Bhaja (Hilsa Fish Fry) is a classic fish fry dish prepared in Bengali cuisine. It is prepared on all
        special occasion as fish is considered auspicious in Bengali culture. Hisla Fish Fry - Ilish Maach Bhaja doesn't
        really call for a recipe, but it definitely needs to be recorded and shared.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 steaks of hilsa fish</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>¼ cup mustard oil </li>
        <li>½ red onion </li>
        <li> 2 fresh green chili</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the fish fillet with salt and turmeric and keep aside for 10 minutes.</liv>
        <li>Pour the oil in a heavy bottom wok and let it heat until you see smoke. This is a very critical step. If the
            oil is not hot enough, and you drop the fish fillets, it will get stuck to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Slide the marinated fish very carefully in the hot oil.
        </li>
        <li>Let it fry for 2 minutes and the try to flip it very carefully. If it feels like it is stuck to the bottom
            of the pan, give it 1 to 2 more minutes for the fish to fry completely.</li>
        <li>Flip and fry for 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Take it off the pan once done and switch off the heat.</li>
        <li>The oil is still pretty hot, so drop the sliced red onion and slit green chili. Let it fry for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Serve the pipping hot Ilish Maach Bhaja with steamed rice and top it with the cooked soft onion, green chili
            and some of that aromatic mustard oil.</li>
        <li>Enjoy while it's warm.</li>
    </ol>
